## Collaboration with Git

For this project, all members of the class will be working on the same git repo. 
This could pose all kinds of problems for pushing changes, if we don't follow the proper process of forking the repo. 
This tutorial is adapted from <http://r-bio.github.io/intro-git-rstudio/>.

### Branching

We will each create a branch of the RNASeqProject repo on the <https://github.com/Bucknell-Biol364/RNASeqProject> page.
On the top right, click `Fork`. 
Then click your personal Github repo, to create the branch there.
